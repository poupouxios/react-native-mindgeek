# React Native Mindgeek Hack Cyprus Contest App

React Native Mindgeek Hack Cyprus Contest is an application build for the [Hack Cyprus](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackcyprus/) event in order for the participants to register and get in the draw for a price.

# Description

As in the past I was involved in iOS developing and I was struggling with the design and positioning elements, I wanted to try and see how React Native works and approaches the design.

The app communicates with a back end that post the data through an OAUTH authentication. (The current credentials inside the apiHandler.js are not available anymore). The back end was a simple Laravel project.

Some extra libraries are being used such as:

 - [react-native-loading-spinner-overlay](https://github.com/joinspontaneous/react-native-loading-spinner-overlay)
 - [react-native-modalbox](https://github.com/maxs15/react-native-modalbox)
 - [react-native-simple-radio-button](https://github.com/moschan/react-native-simple-radio-button)
 - [react-transform-hmr](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr)
 - [tcomb-form-native](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb-form-native)

It was only used for iOS but it can be easily ported to Android.
